    \frametitle{Introduction}
    \textbf{Diffusion models} were introduced in 2015, by inspiration from nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

    These models work by progressively destroying the structure in data through iterative diffusions (e.g. through noising). Then the reverse generative process is learned from the training data.

    The latent features in the dataset are learnt effectively model how the data ``diffuses'' in the latent space.
