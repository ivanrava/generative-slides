    Most generative models are unsupervised Deep Learning ones which learn to generate data from the learnt, \textbf{latent representations}.

    \textbf{Latent representation} = spatially-reduced and high-level abstract representation of the target data. Usually found in the middle of an encoder-decoder architecture.

    These are some of the most common models employed in generative deep learning:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders.
        \item Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).
        \item Diffusion Models.
    \end{itemize}
