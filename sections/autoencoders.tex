    \frametitle{Autoencoders}
    An \textbf{autoencoder} is made up of two parts: an encoder and a decoder, with the latent representation (called code) in the middle.
    $$\text{Encoder} \to \text{Code} \to \text{Decoder}$$
    They were used in the first DL models, and they are still used today inside the bigger models.
